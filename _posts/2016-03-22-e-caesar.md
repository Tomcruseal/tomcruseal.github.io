>Caesar encoding may be one of the simplest and most famous private key cryptosystems.The core theory of it is shifting code off certain bits.We digitalize the alphabet by letting A=00,B=01,...Z=25,then the encoding function is:
>$$f(p)=p+3\ mod\ 26$$
>
>Since for simple shift code,every single character has a one-to-one and onto reflection to another distinct character,it is quite easy to break such cryptosystem.Here is the more sophisticated one,called **affine cryptosystem**.The encoding function for **affine cryptosystem** is:
>
$$f(p)=ap+b\ mod\ 26$$
>
>And,of course,it must have and only have one corresponding decoding function(inverse function),the process for obtaining its inverse function is:
>
To obtain its inverse function,firstly,we asume that there exists a *c* such that:
$$c=ap+b\ mod\ 26 $$
followed by
$$p=(c-b)*a{-1}\ mod\ 26 $$
By changing the invariables,we obtain its decoding function:
>$$f^{-1}(p)=p*a{-1}-b*a{-1}\ mod\ 26 $$
>Certainly,such function can be extended to polyalphabet form,that is,by replacing *a* with matrix *A*,and integer *p*,*b* with vector *p* and *b*.
>
$$f(\vec{p})=\textbf{A}\vec{p}+\vec{b} $$
Of course,matrix **A** has to be invertible here

>The **RSA** cryptosystem,introduced by R.Rivest,A.Shamir,and L.Adleman,is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers,which is usually a 1024 bits binary number.

>Before illustrating the process of **RSA** encoding and decoding,I think it's neccessary to introduce **Euler' Theorem** and its deduction,**Fermat's Little Theorem**.
>**Euler's Theorem**:
>$$Let\ a\ and\ n\ be\ integers\  such\ that\ n>0\ and\ gcd(a,n)=1.Then\ a^{\phi(n)}\equiv1 $$
>
>If we replace n with p.then we obtain **Fermat's Little Theorem**:
$$Let\ p\ be\ any\ prime\ number\ and\ suppose\ that\gcd(p,a)=1,then\ a^{p-1}\equiv1$$
>
>Having known the mathematical basic knowledge for **RSA**,next goes the process of **RSA** encoding:
>
>Firstly,we choose two prime numbers ,*p* and *q*.By multiplying *p* and *q*,we obtain *n*.Then,we can compute :
>
$$Euler-\phi-function:\phi(n)=(p-1)*(q-1)$$
After that,we start randomly choose an integer *E*
such that $gcd(E,m)=1$
Then,using **Euclidean algorithm**,we can find a number D such that $DE\equiv1(mod\ m)$
Among those numbers,n and E are made public.
>
>Then,I want to prove why the **RSA** cryptosystem works.For $DE\equiv1(mod\ m)$,there must exist a *k* such that 
$$km+1=\phi(n)k+1=DE$$
Now,there are 2 conditions:$gcd(x,n)=1$or $gcd(x,n)\neq1$
For the first condition,asume *x* is the plaintext and *y* is the ciphertext,then $y^{D}=(x^{E})^{D}=x^{DE}=x^{km+1}=x^{k\phi(n)+1}=(x^{\phi(n)})^{k}x=(1)^{k}x=x\ mod\ n$
As a result,in this case,**RSA** encodes and decodes correctly. 
For another case,since $gcd(x,n)\neq1$,we can simply asume that *x* is a multiple of *p* but not *q*,so there exists a *r* such that $x=rp$,after that,it's easy to prove it.
>
>So,how to break the **RSA** encryption?There are many methods.Try to factorize *n* is one of the many ways.By factorizing *n*,we attempt to obtain *p* and *q* and then it will be natural to get *D* which is our final target.

>**Question that I haven't solve yet**:In a group $Z_{n}$,What's the difference between generators and  units?
